# Python**
**Difference between Python Shell(Interactive mode) VS Script Mode(Editor Window)?****
=Both(**IDLE**)are the python interpretor to run the code

**Python shell(Interactive mode)** is the one of the interperetor to run the program but its has many demerits like below:-
1.its excute the program or code Line by Line.(one line at a time).
2.You cannot run multiple line of program or multiple line of code in it.
3.Its perform to slow because of line by line excution of program.
4.You can save the program or you cannot reuse the program or code easily.
5.Limited Debugging feature.
6.Messy in python shell.
7.Leaern basic syntex.
8.Not reusable/messy.

**Script Mode(Editor Window)** is the one of the interepretor to run the program have many benefits like below:-
1.Run multiple line program or code at once(too fast).
2.Unlimited Debugging Feature.
3.You can save the file(.py) as well reuse the file anytime.
4.Extension of save file(.py).
5.Writing actual script or program.
6.Writing and saving full program.
7.Input or output multi step logic.
8.Reusable/Clean/Organise.

| --: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Basic UI & Features**                    | IDLE lacks modern IDE features like auto-complete suggestions, refactoring tools, version control (Git), etc. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Plugin or Extension Support**         | You can't install extensions to enhance IDLE ‚Äî what you see is what you get.                                  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Limited Debugging**                      | Basic step-through debugger only; lacks breakpoints panel, watch window, call stack, etc.                     |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Not Great for Large Projects**           | Difficult to manage files and folders in larger apps (no project explorer or file tree).                      |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Integrated Terminal**                 | Unlike VS Code or PyCharm, you can't run system commands or pip installs in the same window.                  |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Poor UI for Data Science Work**          | No built-in support for plots, dataframes, or rich visual output like Jupyter or Colab.                       |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Native Virtual Environment Handling** | You have to set it up manually using command line; no venv chooser in UI.                                     |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | **Performance Drops on Large Scripts**     | IDLE may freeze or slow down when running long or complex scripts.                                            |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ | **Doesn‚Äôt Auto Save**                      | You must manually save before running scripts (no autosave or version history).                               |
| üîü | **No Code Linting or Suggestions**         | It won‚Äôt warn you about syntax errors or style issues unless you run the code.                                |
| üîü | **No Git, no extensions, no real project view**

**There are five main types/tools used to run Python code, each serving different purposes based on development, testing, automation, and learning needs. Here's a brief and precise summary:**

**1. Python Interpreters (Command Line / Terminal)**
Tool: python or python3 command
Use: Run .py scripts directly from terminal or command prompt.

**2. IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**
Popular Tools:
IDLE(Python Default)
PyCharm
VS Code
Spyder
Thonny
Use: Write, run, debug, and manage projects with advanced features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.

**3. Text Editors + Terminal
Popular Tools:**

Sublime Text
Notepad++
Atom
Use: Write code in the editor, then run via terminal or integrated terminal.

**4. Jupyter Notebooks**
Tool: jupyter notebook or JupyterLab
Use: Interactive, cell-based execution. Ideal for data science, visualization, and learning.

**5. Online Platforms / Interpreters**
Popular Tools:
Google Colab
Replit
PythonAnywhere
Use: Run Python code in a browser without local setup. Good for quick testing, sharing, and cloud execution.

**‚úÖ Bonus (Advanced Use Cases)**
Scripting in Software: Python scripts embedded in tools like Blender or ArcGIS.
Automation Tools: Use with cron, .bat files, or task schedulers to automate Python script execution.

**üìå Summary Table**
| Tool Type         | Example Tools       | Best For                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Interpreters      | Terminal (`python`) | Simple script execution               |
| IDEs              | PyCharm, VS Code    | Full-featured development             |
| Text Editors      | Sublime, Atom       | Lightweight editing                   |
| Jupyter Notebooks | Jupyter, Colab      | Data science, education               |
| Online Platforms  | Colab, Replit       | Quick tests, sharing, cloud execution |

**Python Syntex**

Execute Python Syntax
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:(python shell/interactive mode)
Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:(script mode/editor window)


**Python Indentation**
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

The number of spaces(indentation) is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
(if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!"))

**examplpe:-

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")**

syntax error
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

syntax wrong
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
