# Python**
**Difference between Python Shell(Interactive mode) VS Script Mode(Editor Window)?****
=Both(**IDLE**)are the python interpretor to run the code

**Python shell(Interactive mode)** is the one of the interperetor to run the program but its has many demerits like below:-
1.its excute the program or code Line by Line.(one line at a time).
2.You cannot run multiple line of program or multiple line of code in it.
3.Its perform to slow because of line by line excution of program.
4.You can save the program or you cannot reuse the program or code easily.
5.Limited Debugging feature.
6.Messy in python shell.
7.Leaern basic syntex.
8.Not reusable/messy.

**Script Mode(Editor Window)** is the one of the interepretor to run the program have many benefits like below:-
1.Run multiple line program or code at once(too fast).
2.Unlimited Debugging Feature.
3.You can save the file(.py) as well reuse the file anytime.
4.Extension of save file(.py).
5.Writing actual script or program.
6.Writing and saving full program.
7.Input or output multi step logic.
8.Reusable/Clean/Organise.

| --: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Basic UI & Features**                    | IDLE lacks modern IDE features like auto-complete suggestions, refactoring tools, version control (Git), etc. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Plugin or Extension Support**         | You can't install extensions to enhance IDLE ‚Äî what you see is what you get.                                  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Limited Debugging**                      | Basic step-through debugger only; lacks breakpoints panel, watch window, call stack, etc.                     |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Not Great for Large Projects**           | Difficult to manage files and folders in larger apps (no project explorer or file tree).                      |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Integrated Terminal**                 | Unlike VS Code or PyCharm, you can't run system commands or pip installs in the same window.                  |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Poor UI for Data Science Work**          | No built-in support for plots, dataframes, or rich visual output like Jupyter or Colab.                       |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **No Native Virtual Environment Handling** | You have to set it up manually using command line; no venv chooser in UI.                                     |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | **Performance Drops on Large Scripts**     | IDLE may freeze or slow down when running long or complex scripts.                                            |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ | **Doesn‚Äôt Auto Save**                      | You must manually save before running scripts (no autosave or version history).                               |
| üîü | **No Code Linting or Suggestions**         | It won‚Äôt warn you about syntax errors or style issues unless you run the code.                                |
| üîü | **No Git, no extensions, no real project view**

**‚ùå When Not to Use IDLE (Just as Important)**

Avoid IDLE if:-
You're building complex projects or apps
You need version control (Git)
You're working with data science tools (e.g., pandas, matplotlib)
You want code suggestions, linting, or auto-formatting
You prefer dark themes or customization

Use tools like:-
**VS Code** ‚Üí general dev(lightweight, very powerful)
**PyCharm** ‚Üí professional dev(full-featured for serious apps)
**Jupyter Notebook** ‚Üí data science
